title: "The Production Era"
---

The Production Era, spanning from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, marked a significant phase in the evolution of marketing. This era was characterized by a shift towards mass production driven by the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which saw the development and proliferation of machinery and steam power facilitating large-scale production[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/)[2](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/work-in-late-19th-century/#:~:text=The%20late%2019th,perfected%20by%20British%20textile%20manufacturers). Here's a more detailed exposition of the Production Era under the requested headings:

### **Characteristics:**

1. **Mass Production:** The core characteristic of the Production Era was the emphasis on mass production. Businesses primarily focused on producing goods as efficiently and in as large quantities as possible to meet the growing demands of expanding markets. This was largely facilitated by technological advancements like the assembly line and mechanized factories[2](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/work-in-late-19th-century/#:~:text=The%20late%2019th,perfected%20by%20British%20textile%20manufacturers)[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/).
2. **Economies of Scale:** As companies scaled up their production capabilities, they began to realize economies of scale, where the cost per unit of production decreases with increasing scale. This was critical for achieving cost leadership in the market[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/).
3. **Standardization and High Production Efficiency:** The era saw a focus on standardization and achieving high production efficiency through repetitive and standardized processes. This approach was believed to reduce costs and subsequently lower the price of goods for consumers[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/)[3](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20features%20of,standardization%20and%20large%20scale%20production).

### **Marketing Focus:**

1. **Product-Centric Approach:** The marketing focus during this era was heavily product-centric. The prevailing mindset was that a good product would sell itself, with little to no consideration for consumer preferences or needs. The emphasis was on creating products that were affordable and readily available to consumers[4](https://hivestudio.net/the-5-evolution-eras-of-marketing/#:~:text=Source%20MotorTrend,product%20would%20simply%20sell%20itself)[5](https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/1-production-era-companies-focused-production-consumer-would-buy-products-produced-t-f-2-s-q56220034#:~:text=During%20the%20%E2%80%9C%20Production%20Era%E2%80%9D,most%20important%20marketing%20mix%20tool).
2. **Limited Advertising:** Although advertising was present, it was limited compared to later eras. The primary goal was to inform consumers about the availability of products rather than to create a brand identity or understand consumer preferences[6](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ushistory2os2xmaster/chapter/a-new-american-consumer-culture/#:~:text=By%201900%2C%20American%20businesses%20were,new%20goods%20were%20constantly%20offered).
3. **Price Over Quality:** Companies believed that consumers valued the price of a product over its quality. This assumption led to a focus on reducing production costs to offer lower prices to consumers, often at the expense of product quality[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/).

### **Examples:**

1. **Ford Motor Company:** One of the quintessential examples of the Production Era's marketing ethos is the Ford Motor Company. Under the leadership of Henry Ford, the company epitomized the era's emphasis on mass production, standardization, and cost reduction. Ford's implementation of the assembly line drastically reduced the cost of the Model T, making automobiles affordable for a broad segment of the population[1](https://www.marketingstudyguide.com/production-era/).
2. **Slater Mill:** Another company that dominated this era was Slater Mill, which along with Ford Motor Company, hired thousands of factory workers to meet the demand for production[7](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marketing-evolution-production-era-idara-joseph#:~:text=This%20era%20was%20dominated%20by,to%20learn%20more%20about%20the).
