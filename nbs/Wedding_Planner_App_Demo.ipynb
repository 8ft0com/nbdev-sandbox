    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Easily Connect Wedding Vendors To Wedding Planners To Automate the booking process for clients, vendors, and planners in a single location to make booking vendors easy for wedding vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acceptance Criteria\n",
    "This project is to develop a website and mobile application for event management which connects host(Customer) to event planner. Main goal is to provide customer user to ability to add their event on the application and find the best fit vendor (Event organiser) for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User will register into Website & mobile application with required information like email address, name, mobile number and password. Alternative way to get registered into Website & mobile application is via social media platform like google and Facebook.\n",
    "- User can create the new event with event information and event type and save to their account. After adding the event user will find the best vendor for them and send quote request to vendor user.\n",
    "- Vendor user will receive the quotation request and with detail information for event. After quote request both host and vendor user can communicate via messaging. All the event deal related this will be in messaging like quotation, bargaining and media sharing.\n",
    "- There will be notification system to send the alert to host user for activity trigger on platform.\n",
    "- Other side of website and mobile app is vendor user who will provide service to host for event. Vendor user will register into Website & mobile application with required information about them and their firm. After registration their business profile will be send to admin user and admin user will approve or reject their profile.\n",
    "- Vendor user can view the event created by host user with all the details of event and its budget. There will be subscription plan mechanism for vendor user to request to initiate conversion with host for created event. Vendor user will subscribe for specific plan and based on subscribe specific plan vendor user can bid on the host’s event.\n",
    "- Vendor user can view the quote request from host user with detail event information. Vendor user can communicate with host user in messaging service.\n",
    "- Admin will be main controller of website and mobile application and will manage the mobile application from backend admin panel\n",
